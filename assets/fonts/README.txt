Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I created this project to work on my CSS grid and flexbox knowledge. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1 class="social-media-header">
            Social Media <span id="ten-x">10x</span>
            <span id="first-itallic">Faster</span> with AI
          </h1>
```
```CSS

    .grow-followers {
        background-color:hsl(256, 67%, 59%);
        grid-column-start: 3;
        grid-column-end: 5;
        grid-row-start: 3;
        padding: 1.5rem;
    }
```
